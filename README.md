Soil Prediction using Machine Learning.
Project Overview
Soil prediction is crucial for modern agriculture, as it helps in understanding soil properties, fertility, and suitability for different crops. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze soil characteristics and predict soil types or fertility levels based on parameters such as pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), moisture, and texture.

By using machine learning algorithms, farmers and agriculturists can make data-driven decisions, optimize crop selection, and improve soil management practices.

Objectives.
To predict soil types or fertility levels using historical soil data.

To analyze various soil parameters such as pH, moisture, NPK values, and texture.

To develop a machine learning model that provides accurate predictions.

To assist farmers in making informed decisions for better crop yield.

Dataset
The dataset consists of various soil parameters collected from different regions. It includes:

pH Level – Acidity or alkalinity of the soil.

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) Content – Essential nutrients for plant growth.

Moisture Content – Indicates water retention in the soil.

Organic Matter – The presence of decomposed plant material.

Soil Texture (Sand, Silt, Clay) – Determines the physical properties of the soil.

Crop Suitability – Optional column that indicates which crops grow best in the given soil.

Implementation Steps.
Data Collection – Gather soil sample data from reliable sources.

Data Preprocessing – Clean the dataset, handle missing values, normalize features.

Feature Selection – Identify key parameters that influence soil classification.

Model Selection & Training – Train different ML models and select the best-performing one.

Model Evaluation – Test the model on unseen data and improve performance if needed.

Deployment – Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for easy access.

Expected Outcome.
A trained machine learning model that accurately predicts soil types.

A user-friendly interface (web or mobile) where farmers can input soil data and get predictions.

Improved agricultural decision-making based on data-driven insights.
